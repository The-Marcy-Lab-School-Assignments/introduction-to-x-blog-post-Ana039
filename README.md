# Next.js: React's Glow-Up Era

### Ana Almonte

 If your comfortable with React, your already 90% of the way to mastering Next.js. React gives you the power, but Next.js makes it easy to use like dropping a strong engine into a Porsche. Its fast, smooth and ready for the real world, with built in features like routing,  performance SEO (Search Engine Optimization)  built in.

# Why Next.js ?

Companies like Netflix, Tiktok, and Hulu chose Next.js over plain React for good reason. While React handles UI beautifully, Next.js handles everything else: routing, performance optimization, SEO, and deployment.

# The key differences
 **Basic React Router structure**:

``` javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
return (
<BrowserRouter>
<Routes>
<Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
<Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
<Route path="/blog/:example" element={<BlogPost />} />
</Routes>
</BrowserRouter>
);
}
```
**Routing in Next.js**: Files instead of Code

```javascript
pages/
  index.js          // Homepage
  about.js          // /about page
  blog/
    [example].js       // /blog/anything

```
Create a file, get a route. That's it.
# Set up

**React**:
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
# Then install React Router
npm install react-router-dom
# Then configure react routing manually
# Then build for production
npm run build
# Then set up deployment
```
**Next.js**:  zero configuration 
```bash
npx create-next-app my-app
npm run dev
```
You're done. Everything is handled for you. 

# What stays the same

The React you know and love dosen't change. Components, hooks, state management.
 It all remains the same: 
```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```
**This component still works exactly the same in both React and Next.js.**

# My experience
While learning Next.js I built a mini Pinterest clone as a side project. Compared to using plain React, everything felt easier. Pages loaded faster, images were optimized automatically, and routing was built in. I did not deploy it, but building with Next.js helped me understand how it simplifies a lot of setup and improves performance while also saving a lot of time. 


# Should you switch?

If you're building more than just a basic project, then yes. Next.js is worth learning. It gives you powerful features like faster loading, better search engine optimization, and tools that make your app look more professional.

If you already know React, the learning curve is small. You're not starting over, you're just learning a better way to use what you already know.

# Getting started

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-project
cd my-project
npm run dev
```
I recommend you start with the [Next.js tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn) (offical next.js site) it's great and builds on React concepts you already understand.

**Next.js takes React to the next level. It dosen't replace React, it optimizes it.**
